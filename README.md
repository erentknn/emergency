# Emergency Model- Demo 

So this was a notebook of mine, and i wanted to deploy it on Heroku, with CircleCI.

This is the first project i deploy using Tensorflow and Keras, normally i built the model with resnet but Heroku's 500 mb space wasnt enough so I remove resnet completely thus model might give you wrong predictions. If you want to look at original notebook you can find it here: https://github.com/erentknn/Notebooks/blob/master/Emergency%20Classification%20CNN/EmergencyorNot.ipynb

You can try the app here: https://nn-model.herokuapp.com/
